# MersennePrimeFindingAlgorithm
My implementation of the Lucasâ€“Lehmer primality test, used to find Mersenne Primes- prime numbers of the form 2^n - 1 , where n is a prime number. The largest prime number known till date, 2^74,207,281 - 1 (a 22,338,618 digit number) is a Mersenne Prime and was discovered in Jan 2016.

### Sample Output:

The program checks if 2^r - 1 is a Mersenne Prime. Enter value of r
11213         
2^11213-1 is prime
